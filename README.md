# COP4331-Small-Project---Team-5
- Team composed of: Aidan Alich, Vaishal Devasenapathy, Brian Huang, Ava Sanford, and George Morillo
- This repository is a MIRROR of the droplet at 142.93.67.135
@TODO - The LAMPAPI currently holds the files needed to emulate the Colors assignment, not the files for the small project assignment
- the /DB folder is intended to hold all tables (tbl_Users.sql, tbl_Contacts.sql ) used on the server
- - note that this is not a 'real' folder containing files on the server, but rather a representation of all the data stored in the SQL database.
- the /html/LAMPAPI folder is intended to hold all api endpoints (Login.php, etc.) used on the server
- /html will reflect the root directory /var/www/html of the server, and is organized as follows (TODO - update as changes are made):
    root (/var/www/html)
        css (/var/www/ html /css)
        images (/var/www/ html /images)
        js (/var/www/ html /js)
        LAMPAPI (/var/www/ html /LAMPAPI)
        index.html
        color.html
